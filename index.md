I am a graduate student at [Gergo Orban](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1JeMZad2LKcC)'s lab, also affiliated with the [Center for Cognitive Computation](https://ccc.ceu.edu) at CEU. I've previously been on an internship at [Chris Summerfield](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ymlcN9AAAAAJ)'s lab at the University of Oxford and done undergraduate research at the Institute of Experimental Medicine under [Szabolcs KÃ¡li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8gykEqQAAAAJ). My research interest is in normative models of learning and memory in humans and in machine learning.
