I'm a postdoc co-supervised by [Charley Wu](https://hmc-lab.com/) and [Peter Dayan](https://www.mpg.de/12309370/biological-cybernetics-dayan) at the University of Tübingen and the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics. I pursued my PhD in [Gergo Orban](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1JeMZad2LKcC)'s lab at the Wigner Research Centre, during which I also interned at [Chris Summerfield](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ymlcN9AAAAAJ)'s lab at the University of Oxford. During my undergraduate studies, I worked with [Szabolcs Káli](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8gykEqQAAAAJ) at the Institute of Experimental Medicine. 

I’m interested in understanding how the brain abstracts observations into compact internal models that enable efficient behavior despite operating under severe resource constraints. My research primarily revolves around normative approaches to learning and memory, utilising computational models.
