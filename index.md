I am a graduate student at [Gergo Orban](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1JeMZad2LKcC&hl=en&oi=ao)'s lab, also affiliated with the [Center for Cognitive Computation](https://ccc.ceu.edu) at CEU. I've previously been on an internship at [Chris Summerfield's lab](https://humaninformationprocessing.com/) at the University of Oxford and done undergraduate research at the Institute of Experimental Medicine under Szabolcs KÃ¡li. My research interest is in normative models of learning and memory in humans and in machine learning.
