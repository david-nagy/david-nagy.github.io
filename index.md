I'm currently a postdoc working with [Charley Wu](https://hmc-lab.com/) and [Peter Dayan](https://www.mpg.de/12309370/biological-cybernetics-dayan) at the University of Tübingen and the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics. I completed my PhD in [Gergo Orban](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1JeMZad2LKcC)'s lab at the Wigner Research Centre, during which I also interned at [Chris Summerfield](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ymlcN9AAAAAJ)'s lab at the University of Oxford. During my undergraduate studies, I worked with [Szabolcs Káli](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8gykEqQAAAAJ) at the Institute of Experimental Medicine. 

My main interest is understanding how the brain abstracts experiences into effective internal models, despite operating under severe resource constraints. My research uses computational models to explore normative theories of learning and memory. For more details, see [my phd thesis](http://davidnagy.web.elte.hu/preprints/dnagy_thesis_elte.pdf).
